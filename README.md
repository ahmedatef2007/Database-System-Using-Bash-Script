2. **List Tables:** Display a list of tables in the connected database.
3. **Drop Table:** Delete a table and its contents.
4. **Insert into Table:** Add new records to a table, ensuring data integrity with specified column data types.
5. **Select From Table:** Retrieve and display rows from a table in a readable format.
6. **Delete From Table:** Remove specific rows from a table.
7. **Update Table:** Modify existing records in a table, ensuring compatibility with specified data types and primary key constraints.

# How to use it:
1. open the terminal from any linux distribution
2. cd to the project directory
3. write the command . ./main
